# Real-Time Face Recognition Web App using Flask & OpenCV

This project is a **real-time face recognition web application** built using **Flask**, **OpenCV**, and the **face_recognition library**. It detects and recognizes faces using a webcam, displaying the live video feed on a webpage.

------

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Web interface built with Flask
- Labels known faces (e.g., “Abin”, “Jerin”) with bounding boxes
- Simple, lightweight, and customizable

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- Flask – for web server and routing
- OpenCV – for handling video capture and drawing
- face_recognition – for facial detection and matching
- HTML (Jinja2) – for the front-end template

## 🧠 How it Works
- Loads known face images (Abin, Jerin) and encodes them.
- Captures frames from the webcam in real time.
- Detects faces and compares with known encodings.
- Draws bounding boxes and labels recognized individuals.
- Streams the processed video to a webpage.

## 📦 Dependencies
- txt
- Copy
- Edit
- flask
- opencv-python
- face_recognition
- numpy

## 📄 To-Do & Improvements
- Add face registration through the UI
- Attendance logging
- Deploy on cloud (e.g., Heroku, Render)
- Optimize performance for multiple users
